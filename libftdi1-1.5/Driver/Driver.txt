You need to install libusb Windows backend supported drivers 
in order to use libftdi1 under Windows. You can usesing Zadig 
from the libwdi project to do that.

In general, you should use WinUSB driver since it is the best
supported by libusb Windows backend. You should avoid
using libusb0.sys as it is not well supported by libusb
Windows backend yet. 

libusbk is usable as well if you want to use libusb-win32 along 
with libusb-1.0 Windows.

You can also try usbdk which is not as mature as WinUSB but
it offers an advantage that you can use it along with the
default FTDI vendor driver (eg: VCP serial port and D2XX function).
